![Logo](./foundry-casino-heist.png)

A Collection of Casino Heist's Challenges written in Foundry- Perfect for those who doesn't want to deploy anything and want to exercise their Test Writting skill in Foundry.

## Requirement
What you need to prepare:
1. [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/) 
2. Snacks üç´üç™

All the libraries such as [Openzepplin Contracts](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/upgrades-plugins/foundry-upgrades) is already included in the GitHub Repository.

## Mini-Guide
This is the directory and its usage.

- `/src` - all vulnerable contracts here.
- `/test` - all testfile 
- `/reading-mats/docs` - all vulnerabilities Explanation
- `/reading-mats/Mithrough` - all Mitigations & Walkthroughs

## How to Play
1. Clone the Repository
```shell
git clone https://github.com/Kiinzu/foundry-casino-heist.git
```

2. You will find the Challenge in the `/src` accordingly to their Category.
    - Basic (Introductory)
    - Common (Common Vulnerabilities)
    - VIP (Easier Stuff, trust me)

3. You will find all the test in one folder `/test` (Basic, Common, VIP in one place).
4. Some might require you to write Exploit Contract, some you can just edit the Test Directly. There will be `// Write Exploit Here`, that's the only place you should edit and some may include `vm.warp()`, you might also want to change this if you think you need it.
```solidity
// Example: test/MasterOfBlackjack.t.sol
    function testIfSolved() public {
        // Setup for Player
        vm.startPrank(player, player);
        vm.deal(player, 1 ether);

        // Write Exploit here
        vm.warp(19); // Feel free to change this to any block.timestamp that satisfy the requirement

        vm.stopPrank();
        assertEq(challSetup.isSolved(), true);
    }
```
‚ö†Ô∏è - **Do Not Change the Setup for player!**

5. To Test if solved, you can simply run this command
```shell
forge test test/MasterOfBlackjack.t.sol -vvvv
```
6. add `.env` file in the root directory
```
RPC_URL=
SetupADDR=
BriefADDR=
PRIVATE_KEY=
WalletADDR=
StorageSLOT=
```
7. That's it! You good to go.
